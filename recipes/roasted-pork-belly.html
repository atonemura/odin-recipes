      <h4>Pork belly rolled in lemongrass, scallions and red onions.
        This is different and simpler from the traditional way of making lechon, which is to roast over a bed of hot charcoal and continuously rotate until the skin gets brown and crunchy. </h4>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 slab of pork belly with bones removed</li>
            <li>3 stalk lemongrass leaves</li>
            <li>3 pieces scallions</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh milk</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Instructions: </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Lay the pork belly on a flat surface in a way that the side with the skin is facing down. Rub the salt and pepper all over the top of the pork belly (meat part). Let it stand for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Arrange the lemongrass, scallions, and onion slices on one one of the belly. Roll the side where you had the lemongrass all the way to the opposite side until a spiral shape is formed. Secure the rolled pork belly by tying it with a kitchen twine. Rub the oil all over the skin.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350F. Arrange the pork belly in a roasting pan and roast for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove the belly from the oven and brush with fresh milk. Put it back into the oven and continue to roast for 30 minutes or until the skin is brown and crispy.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven. Let it cool down for 15 minutes. Slice the Roasted Pork Belly</li>
            <li>Share and enjoy!</li>
          </ol>
